# Note on Special Relativity
## 1. What is Special Relativity?

Special Relativity is basically a theory about space-time. It especially deals with 'special' spacetime, i.e., flat spacetime. Basically, mass curves spacetime. So flat means that there is no mass or mass is so small that space is almost not curved, i.e., almost flat. If we consider 'general' spacetime, i.e., spacetime with curvature, we should need a general spacetime theory, which is famously called general relativity. The name, special of special relativity and general of general relativity came from these context.

## 2. What is Lorentz Symmetry?

In physics, Symmetry has special meanings. Symmetry needs two ingredients, one is called operation and one is called object. If we take an operation on some object and the object retains a same form after the operation, we say object is symmetric about that operation.

If we have a vertical line passing through center of snowflake and take an inversing operation on the snowflake, then snowflake still retains a same form. We say snowflake is symmetric about an inversion about a vertical line. Also as you can see, snowflake is symmetric about 60 degree rotation.

Lorentz Symmetry states that physical law or constants should be symmetric about inertial observer. One example is speed of light. Lorentz Symmetry if we meausre the speed of light by one inertial observer, then take an operation, which changes the observer to other inertial observer, and meausre the speed of light by the other observer, then the speed of light should be same.
