# Note on Special Relativity
## 1. What is Special Relativity?

Special Relativity is basically a theory about space-time. It especially deals with 'special' spacetime, i.e., flat spacetime. Basically, mass curves spacetime. So flat means taht there is no mass or mass is so small that space is almost not curved, i.e., almost flat. If we consider 'general' spacetime, i.e., spacetime with curvature, we should need a general spacetime theory, which is famously called general relativity. The name, special of special relativity and general of general relativity came from these context.

## 2. What is Lorentz Symmetry?

In physics, Symmetry has special meanings. Symmetry needs two ingredients, one is called operation and one is called object. If we take an operation on some object and object retains same form after the operation, we say object is symmetric about that object.
